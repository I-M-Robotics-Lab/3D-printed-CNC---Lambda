# Lambda CNC Router

![Lambda CNC Router](path_to_your_photo.jpg)

Lambda is an open-source CNC router designed by I'M Robotics Lab. It uses 3D-printed ABS for most of its components. It has a workable area of around 600x400 mm and can machine materials including Wood, Aluminum, Brass, Plexiglass, and Plastic. 

Lambda uses the Black Box X32 as a motion-controlling system, while it uses the OpenBuild control software. A unique design in Lambda is that the x-axis ballscrew is placed behind the x-axis aluminum structure, this keeps the ballscrew away from dust and chips.

Straightforward to assemble, and once completed, users have acquired knowledge in CNC building and repair. The cost of it is approximately 1300 US dollars, individuals could reduce cost by replacing the BlackBox control system with cheaper alternatives.
